             Values:
                 notUpdating       (0)
                     The system is not updating the CRL file. This happens when
                     the following conditions are met:
                         1) The system is not manually updating a CRL file, and
                         2) tmnxPkiCAProfAtCrlUpdAdminState is 'outOfService (3)'.

                 autoScheduled     (1)
                     The system is waiting for the next scheduled CRL update time
                     (tmnxPkiCAProfAtCrlUpdNxCrlUpdTm) in an automated
                     CRL update operation. This happens when the following
                     conditions are met:
                         1) tmnxPkiCAProfAtCrlUpdAdminState is 'inService (2)',
                            and
                         2) The next scheduled CRL update time is not reached.

                 autoDownloading   (2)
                     The system is downloading the CRL file in an automated CRL
                     update operation. This happens when the following conditions
                     are met:
                         1) tmnxPkiCAProfAtCrlUpdAdminState is 'inService (2)',
                            and
                         2) The current CRL is invalid, or next scheduled CRL update
                            time is reached.

                 manualDownloading (3)
                     The system is downloading the CRL file in a manual CRL update
                     operation (tmnxPkiCAProfManCrlUpdTable).

                 stopped           (4)
                     The system stopped updating the CRL. This happens when one
                     of the following conditions are met:
                         1) In the automated CRL update case, the system did not find
                            a CRL that qualifies from any of the configured URLs.
                            Meanwhile, tmnxPkiCAProfAtCrlUpdScheduleT is
                            'nextUpdateBased (1)' and the value of
                            tmnxPkiCAProfAtCrlUpdRetryIntv is zero; or
                         2) In the automated CRL update case, the system finds a CRL
                            that qualifies from one of the configured URLs, but
                            the 'nextUpdate' field is missing.
                            Meanwhile, tmnxPkiCAProfAtCrlUpdScheduleT is
                            'nextUpdateBased (1)'; or
                         3) In the manual CRL update case, the system did not find
                            a CRL that qualifies from any of the configured URLs.
                         4) The manual CRL update was aborted by configuring
                            tmnxPkiCAProfManCrlUpdAbort to 'doAction (1)'.

                     tmnxPkiCAProfCrlCurUpdStatus will never be 'stopped (4)' when
                     tmnxPkiCAProfAtCrlUpdScheduleT is 'periodic (2)'. In this
                     case, after attempting all URLs, the system will try to
                     update the CRL file again in
                     tmnxPkiCAProfAtCrlUpdPrdcUpdIntv seconds.

                 autoVerifying     (5)
                     The system is verifying the downloaded CRL file in an
                     automated CRL update operation.

                 manualVerifying   (6)
                     The system is verifying the downloaded CRL file in a
                     manual CRL update operation.";
