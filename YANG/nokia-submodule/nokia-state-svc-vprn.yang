                                 Prune(S,G,rpt) message being sent to RPF'(S,G,rpt).

                                 If the router sees a Join(S,G,rpt) override message being sent by
                                 some other router on the LAN while the timer is still non-zero,
                                 it simply cancels the override timer. If it does not see a
                                 Join(S,G,rpt) message, then on expiry of the override timer, it
                                 sends it's own Join(S,G,rpt) message to RPF'(S,G,rpt). A similar
